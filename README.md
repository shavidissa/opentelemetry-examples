# Sending Trace Data to Tanzu Observability by Wavefront

If your application uses an OpenTelemetry SDK, you can configure the application to send trace data or metrics data to Tanzu Observability using the Wavefront Proxy or the OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Prerequisites

* **A Tanzu Observability account** (If you don't have one already, you
  can [sign up for one](https://tanzu.vmware.com/observability)).
* **Install the Wavefront Proxy**: See [Install a Proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies_installing.html#install-a-proxy) for details.
  
  For example, use Docker to install the proxy. You have to specify:

  * The Tanzu Observability instance (for example, https://longboard.wavefront.com).
  * A Tanzu Observability API token that is linked to an account with **Proxy** permission.
    See [Generating and an API Token](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_api.html#generating-an-api-token).

  ```
  docker run -d \
        -e WAVEFRONT_URL=https://{INSTANCE_NAME}.wavefront.com/api/ \
        -e WAVEFRONT_TOKEN={TOKEN} \
        -e JAVA_HEAP_USAGE=512m \
        -e WAVEFRONT_PROXY_ARGS="--customTracingListenerPorts 30001" \

## Send Trace Data
If your application uses an OpenTelemetry SDK, you can configure the application to send trace data to Tanzu Observability using any of the following options:

* [Directly send OpenTelemetry data to the Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/opentelemetry_tracing.html#send-data-using-the-wavefront-proxy---recommended) - [Recommended]
* Or [use the OpenTelemetry Collector and the Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/opentelemetry_tracing.html#send-data-using-the-opentelemetry-collector)

You can then use our tracing dashboards to visualize any request as a trace, which consists of a hierarchy of spans. This visualization helps you pinpoint where the request is spending most of its time and discover problems.

## Send Metrics Data

If your application uses an OpenTelemetry SDK, you can configure the application to send metrics data to Tanzu Observability using the Tanzu Observability OpenTelemetry Collector. See [ADD LINK WHEN PUBLISHED]() for details.

## OpenTelemetry Collector

Follow these steps to configure the OpenTelemetry Collector:

* Download the `otelcol-contrib` binary from the latest release of
the [OpenTelemetry Collector project](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases) and add it to a preferred directory.

* Download the [`otel_collector_config.yaml`](resources/otel_collector_config.yml) file to the same directory. 

See [OpenTelemetry collector configurations](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/) to learn more.


## Tutorials

This repository includes specific examples for using the OpenTelemetry collector in Java, Python, .NET, and more. 

For example, navigate to the `java-examples` folder and follow the steps in the README to instrument Java Apps with OpenTelemetry.
